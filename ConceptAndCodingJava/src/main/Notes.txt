OOPS - Object Oriented Programming System.
Class is a blueprint, Here Object is a real world Entity.
- Program is divided into Objects.
- Objects provide data hiding, gives important to data.
- Overloading, Inheritance is possible.
- Code Reusability is present.

Objects has 2 Things: Properties[State] and Behaviour[Function].

To Create an Object a class is required.
So class provides a blueprint from which objects can be created.
From one class we can create multiple objects.

Abstraction: It hides the internal implementation ans show only the essential functionality to the user.
             It can be achieved through Interface and Abstract class.
Encapsulation: Make variables as private, Use Getters and Setters to modify/view the value of the variables.
Inheritance: Capability of a class to inherit the properties from their Parent class. can be achieved using extends.
             It can inherit both functions and variables, so we dont have to write them again in child class.
Polymorphism: It can be achieved using [Compile Time / Method Overloading] and [Run Time / Method Overriding].

Objects Relationships:
Is-A-Relationship: Achieve through Inheritance. [Dog IS-A Animal, Car IS-A Animal...]
Has-A-Relationship: Whenever an object is used in another class. [School HAS Students, Bike HAS Engine...]
